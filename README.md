This project is a simple face detection application using OpenCV. It uses a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces in real-time from a webcam feed.

## Features

- Real-time face detection using OpenCV.
- Displays bounding boxes around detected faces.
- Allows the user to exit the application by pressing the `q` key or the `Escape` key.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the required dependencies. The dependencies are listed in the `requirement.txt` file.

### Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

## How to Run
## 1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
## 2. Navigate to the project directory.
## 3. Run the Python script:

## 4. The application will open a window displaying the webcam feed with detected faces highlighted by bounding boxes.
## 5. Press the q key or the Escape key to close the application.
